            the process and level of resources available. Like dating and
            marriage, separation and divorce is a life changing experience but
            very unlike dating/marriage, couples growing apart can have a
            long-term negative impact on the couple involved as well as on their
            near and dear ones. Most couples seeking separation and divorce
            struggle with where to start and whom to turn to seek advise.
            Depending on who and where they turn to first can truly set the
            course for the entire journey that is filled with uncertainty of the
            process resulting in uninformed decisions that can be costly to the

            services as we grow Pragma. */}
            Pragma is founded by two friends who went through their own divorce
            and realized that the divorce process in the United States is
            broken. One key problem with the current system is lack of
            transparency to allow families to make informed decisions. Most
            families seeking separation and divorce struggle with where to start
            and whom to turn for some advice. Depending on who they turn to
            first can truly set the course for the entire journey that can be
            costly delivering suboptimal outcomes. We work with our clients to
            empower them with knowledge to get the confidence for navigating
            their divorce. Our solutions only provide a team of professionals
            that meet the highest standards in professionalism, ethics, and
            services delivery.
